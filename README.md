1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room Client was presented to us as a client that already has their proverbial foot in the door. The Gaming Room has a product that already exists, is playable, and is producing monetary value for them as a company. They, however, want to create a new web-based game that serves any device with internet access, therefore allowing for their users to play on multiple platforms, this game will be based on their already existing game which currently only exists on Android devices.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe I did well on determining the appropriate solutions to the pre-destined requirements set up by the company. I believe I set up a mildly competent summary of the project, the details of what it would entail, as well as a UML diagram that gave it a more visual standard.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I found it a lot simpler to develop the code in this project because I ultimately had something to base it off of. Instead of working from scratch and figuring out how things would fit together at its most basic level, I could leave the conceptualization to the sheet and simply make it functional, something that I find to be quite fun and enjoyable.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I don’t have a part of my document that I’d like to revise, but for the sake of the question, I’d have liked to add more information to the first section and the aspects that did require our input for the sake of the assignment.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user’s needs had to be considered throughout the whole document, users come before anyone else when it comes to a product. They are the underlying motivation and the person giving us their hard-earned money.  In the end, the client and the user are the only parts of the equation that actually matter when it comes to producing a product for them.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing software in a variety of ways, although mainly I stuck with the concept of modularity, a method which I would stick to regardless of the project because of its usefulness in adapting to any given situation.
